# Verite Wallet

## Getting Started

```sh
npm install
```

## Install Expo Go on your mobile device

Install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client). This is where the app will run in development.

## Running the App

From the root of the monorepo, you can run

```sh
npm run wallet
```

Or, from the packages/wallet directory, you can run:

```sh
npm start
```

The console will display a QR code.

On iOS, you can scan the QR code with the camera app. This will launch Expo Go.
On Android, you can launch Expo Go and scan the QR code from within Expo Go.

Once you've scanned the code once, you can launch Expo Go and the app will be listed in the "Recently Opened" list.
